1. Build the extension
2. Use it like this:
    - Call Update() when you want to poll for new data from the gamepad. For example once every frame.
    - To get the button states just call the appropiate function with the desired gamepad (0-3) as the parameter. Example: XBoxPadAButton(0)
    - Use isConnected(int controller) to see if the gamepad is still connected.
    - The thumb sticks and d-pad return values between -1.0 and 1.0.
    - Vibrating does not seem to work.
